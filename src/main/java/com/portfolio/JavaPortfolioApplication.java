Segregated and onboarded ASVs (Application Service Vectors) and Business Applications (BAs) into their respective Gen3 landing zones, aligning with Capital One's account boundary architecture. Used bogie files (declarative YAML configurations) to define all app-level infrastructure including gears for batch jobs, stream consumers, APIs, RDS, DynamoDB, and more â€” ensuring consistent, auditable, and automated provisioning via Capital One's deployment platform. Leveraged the latest AWS gears supported in Gen3, including API Gateway + Lambda, AWS Batch, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon RDS & Aurora PostgreSQL, Amazon DynamoDB, Secrets Manager, EFS, SQS, and SNS for secure and scalable integration across services. Re-engineered microservices using Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.x, leveraging features like virtual threads, pattern matching, and improved record support. Ensured app behavior and performance parity by testing all components post-migration, including API throughput, batch job completion, and stream consumer lag. Deployed apps to production using Capital One's PAR (Production Application Release) model, ensuring proper change control, automated rollout, and rollback strategies. Throttled traffic between Gen2 and Gen3 using Amazon Route 53 weighted routing policies, enabling canary and blue/green deployments. Validated and executed batch jobs in Gen3 using AWS Batch gear by customizing the job definitions, IAM roles, retries, and alarms in the bogie file. Implemented CloudWatch metrics, dashboards, and alerts for monitoring job execution, API errors, stream throughput, and database health. Identified and remediated ATTDs (Application Technical Test Defects) post-deployment by deep-diving into CloudWatch logs, IAM permissions, and bogie misconfigurations. Participated in gear reviews and collaborated with platform teams to onboard any missing gears or fix unsupported configurations in bogie files. Used Spring-IOC concepts and Spring/Chassis MVC pattern and customized the internal Capital One 'Auto loan' application. Developed REST-based services using Spring MVC architecture and used JSON for the data transfer. Worked with platform and application stakeholders to define and steer designing, developing REST APIs and platform services following MVC architecture for Web/Mobile applications using Spring in an agile environment. Worked on different operations of RESTful services like PUT, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE. Actively used the defect tracking tool JIRA to create and track the defects during the QA phase of the project. Developed test cases using JUnit and Cucumber in Test Driven Development (ATTD'S). Implemented AWS IAM for managing the credentials of applications that run on EC2 instances. Implemented AWS solutions using EC2, S3, RDS, EBS, Elastic Load Balancer, Auto-scaling groups. Good experience in SCRUM process of Agile (Iterative) development methodology. Used Apache Tomcat as an application server to deploy various components of the application. Strong experience with REST web services. Experience working with AWS for storage & content delivery and application deployment services. Worked closely with the team to achieve continuous integration and continuous delivery. Experience in deploying the microservices using Docker containers and ability to set up continuous integration and deployment pipeline using Jenkins with GitHub on AWS or any Cloud Service. Experience in Spring Security Framework for User Access Management, JWT token-based authentication and involved OAuth 2.0 configuration for authentication, authorization. Implemented a metrics collection mechanism for the server by utilizing Apache Kafka to stream server-side events. Developed Controller Classes using Spring AOP, Spring Boot, Spring Batch modules and handled the security using Spring Security. Wrote complex SQL queries, PL/SQL, stored procedures, functions, triggers, cursors, and indexes. Used Jenkins to integrate the build and trigger the auto build and nightly deployment based on code check-in in the repo.");
